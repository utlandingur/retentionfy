# Noona App Template

Template repository that quickly scaffolds the building blocks for a Noona app.

## How it works

1. Create a new repository from this template (Use this template)

---

2. Give the new app a descriptive name

3. Project structure

This is a simple Golang server scaffold with most of the required building blocks available out of the box.

The project does include proprietary deployment and build artifacts that are not helpful outside of the Noona deployment cycle, feel free to remove those from your project.

4. Run the setup script with the new project name

5. You can now run the app locally

6. You can also run it with the in-memory database (By default it runs against MongoDB)
